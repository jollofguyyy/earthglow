        <h1>Gumala Aboriginal Corporation Partnership</h1>
        <p>
          EarthGlow Energy, together with its integrated renewable subsidiary,
          Hybrid Systems Australia (HSA), has a joint three-year Memorandum of
          Understanding (MOU) with the Gumala Aboriginal Corporation (GAC).
        </p>
        <p>
          GAC is one of the largest Aboriginal corporations, serving Banjima,
          Yinhawangka and Nyiyaparli people of the Pilbara region in Western
          Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the MOU, GAC will identify remote communities in the Pilbara for
          the introduction of sustainable, renewable energy, reducing reliance
          of fossil fuel generators. Hybrid Systems is converting those remote
          communities to hybrid power by incorporating solar and battery storage
          with existing generators through the installation of Hybrid Systems’
          industry leading Standalone Power Systems (SPS).

        <p>
          EarthGlow Energy CEO Frank Ward noted the importance of the
          partnership with GAC:
        </p>
        <p>
          “We are delighted to have entered this partnership with GAC and to be
          able to utilise our skills and experience in remote, hybrid energy
          generation to add to the incredible work and initiatives that GAC
          undertakes to benefit the lives and futures of the Banjima,
          Yinhawangka and Nyiyaparli Traditional Owners”
        </p>
        <p>
          “This is a practical, useful and environmentally responsible way that
          EarthGlow Energy is utilising our specialist capabilities to give back
          to local communities”
